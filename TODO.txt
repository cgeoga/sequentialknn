As I use this package, I think there are a few extra bits of functionality that
would be nice.

1. For prediction problems with Vecchia methods, it is sometimes nice to
guarantee a certain number of conditioning points in the data. So for that, 
there really should be a specialized routine that takes one collection of points
and makes an immutable tree, and then just for the prediction points does the
dynamic tree part. Even the dynamic tree is going to be much faster than
the HNSW.jl routine, and maybe I should just write a NearestNeighbors.jl
extension for the static tree part. But maybe that should just live here.
